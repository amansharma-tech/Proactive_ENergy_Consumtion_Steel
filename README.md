## Overview
The Energy Consumption Predictor project focuses on developing a predictive model that accurately forecasts energy consumption based on historical data and relevant input features. By analyzing factors such as reactive power, CO2 emissions, power factor, and time-based patterns, the model aims to provide insights and support decision-making related to energy management.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing historical energy consumption records. The dataset includes information on various input parameters such as reactive power, CO2 emissions, power factor, and time-related features. The dataset is preprocessed and used for training and evaluating the predictive model.



## Results
The predictive model achieves a certain level of accuracy in forecasting energy consumption based on the input parameters. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, or R-squared value. The results obtained from the model can be used to gain insights into energy usage patterns and support decision-making related to energy management.
